#GoogleTasks Client library
A client library for get/update...
It uses the [json-parser](https://github.com/udp/json-parser) for parsing the json strings.
I will use this, when it is finished, to build an XFCE4 panel plugin.
##Status
At the moment it is possible to access google via Oauth2, request an access token and refresh it.
###Requirements
Until now, just libcurl.
